# 3D-Image-Rendering

## Objective

This project implements 3-D Image Rendering using a Lambertian Reflectance Model, with two different light sources of our choosing. We use two albedo maps for this function, and plot a 3-D visualization based on these albedo maps.

### Skills Learned

-  Calculated 3D surface normals from heightmaps by understanding and applying geometric transformations.
-  Applied convolution operations using Scipy to extract directional derivatives
-  Implemented the Lambertian reflectance model to simulate lighting effects based on surface orientation and light source positions
-  Visualized 3D vector fields and rendered simulated light interactions on surfaces using Matplotlib.

### Tools Used

- Numpy
- SciPy
- MatPlotLib
